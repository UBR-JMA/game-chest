# Among Us

## Premise
Sci-fi murder mystery in space. One of you is the killer... but which one?

## Platforms
- Windows
- Mobile
- Switch

## Variants
Although the vanilla game is plenty of fun, we've found that there are alternate
game modes/rules that make for exciting and fun gameplay.
### Predator
This mode uses open comms as opposed to the vanilla game type: The "impostor" is
known from the very beginning and they do a slow count from 10 to give the crew
time to scatter. The crew can report on the location of the predator (if they're
alive and think it's a good idea to give themselves away).

Rules modifications:
- Crewmate vision: 5x
- imposter vision: 0.25x
- kill cooldown: 20s
- visual tasks: off
- kill distance: short
- Common Tasks: 2
- Long Tasks: 0
- Short Tasks: 5
- Only sabotage doors and comms

Preferred map: Polus
**NOTE**: Tasks are up to being adjusted for balance.

### Zombie
This mimics a fast-moving zombie moving about the map hunting for braaaaaiiins.
The zombie (impostor) again announces themselves and gives the crew a slow count
of 10 to scatter. Once this is done, the zombie wanders the halls. The zombie has
the following restrictions on their behavior:

- The zombie is restricted to hallways and rooms which serve as hallways (storage,
  cafeteria, etc.)
  - The dividing line is where the floor tiles change.
- The honor system will be used. If the zombie kills a crew member inside a
  room, it's a forfeit for the zombie.
- After passing a room with occupants, the zombie must continue in the same
  direction at least until the next doorway before turning back (no lying in wait
    to ambush those leaving safety).
- Only lights may be sabotaged.

Crew members are, as always, trying to repair the ship while staying alive.

**_NOTE_**: Specifics of game settings have been lost and need to be re-developed.
